    "- $O(1)$: Constant-time algorithm runs in a constant time no matter how large the input is. For example, checking whether the first byte of a file is null `(0x00)` is constant time; no matter how large the file is, we only need to inspect the first byte. As another example, programs that ignore their input and compute the answer to a specific problem are also constant-time, even though this problem might take a very long time.\n",
    "- $O\\left( \\log n \\right)$: Logarithmic-time algorithm runs in time proportional to the logarithm of the input. The most common example is perhaps binary search: given a sorted array (with random access) of nn elements, we can find whether a specific item is in the array or not by using binary search, dividing the search space by half by checking the middle element.\n",
    "- $O(n)$: Linear-time algorithm runs in time proportional to the input. This can be good or bad: when $n$ is the number of elements in an array of integers, radix sorting allows us to sort it in linear-time, a very good performance, but when $n$ is a positive integer and we want to check whether it's prime, doing trial division over all numbers $2, 3, \\ldots, n-1$ is a poor performance.\n",
    "- $O(n \\log n)$: Often encountered in sorting algorithms, a linearithmic-time algorithm runs in time that's not particularly distinguishable from linear-time for \"reasonable\" input. Many comparison-based sorting algorithms (merge sort, heap sort, etc.) take linearithmic-time, because it has been proven to be the best running time possible for comparison-based sorting algorithms.\n",
    "- $O(n^2)$: Quadratic-time algorithms take time proportional to the square of the input. Example algorithms that take this time are schoolbook multiplication of two $n$-digit numbers or two polynomials of degree $n$ (faster algorithms exist, such as Karatsuba's algorithm), some slow sorting algorithms (selection sort and insertion sort), and solving the longest common subsequence problem using dynamic programming.\n",
    "- $O(n^3)$: The most common cubic-time algorithms are perhaps the running times of schoolbook matrix multiplication (again, faster algorithms exist such as Strassen's algorithm), computing determinant using Gaussian elimination (which can be done using matrix multiplication) and finding a triangle in a graph of nn vertices (which can also be done using matrix multiplication). Other than that, a cubic-time algorithm will likely have the structure of a loop through nn values inside another loop of nn values inside a third loop of nn values; the three examples above naturally give rise to this structure, but it's uncommon to see any other.\n",
    "- $O(a^n)$: For an exponential-time algorithm, increasing the input by one is enough to multiply the algorithm's running time (by $a$). Note that if $a < b$, then $a^n = o(b^n)$ (they are not asymptotically the same). An example of this is to evaluate whether a Boolean formula on nn variables can be satisfied; trying each possibility requires $2^n$ cases to be checked (multiplied by the time it takes to actually evaluate the formula).\n",
    "- $O(n!)$: A factorial-time algorithm is even slower. Such algorithms often check every permutation of an array, in which there are $n!$ of them.\n",
